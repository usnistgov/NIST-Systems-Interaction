# Overview

This repository contains a model to study the interactions between system technologies of automated vehicles. The system technologies already implemented in the model are AI, Cybersecurity, Sensing/Perception, and Communications. The model has been developed in two formats: OWL (Web Ontology Language) and a graph database (Neo4j).

## Features


## Usage

- The OWL model can be explored with Protege.
- The graph database model was developed using Neo4j. Please refer to `GraphDatabase/Instructions_to_run_STIM.pdf` for installation instructions.

## Status

While a stable version of the model has been developed, additional instances continue to be added.
