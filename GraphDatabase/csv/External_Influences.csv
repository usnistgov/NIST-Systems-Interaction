E2,Weather,"Rain, Fog, Smoke conditions, Snow"
E3,Experimental Setup/Sensor Position,Experiment design might lead to unwanted influences
E4,Object Reflectivity,Glare causing camera issues
E5,Laser Interference,Causing noise in LiDAR point cloud
E6,Sensor Occlusion,"Dirt, sleet, dust, mud, leaf"
E7,Object Occlusion,Signs and traffic signals occluded leading to degradation in S/P and AI
E8,Obstacle Size,Different sizes might have different effects on detection algorithm
E9,Electromangnetic Interference,"These can impact sensors,comms systems and control unit of vehicle"
E10,Manufacturing Defect,Manufacturing defect that would be present in a given batch of product
E11,Physical Wear and Tear,Deterioration of sensors overtime might lead to malfunction
E12,Integration Issues,Integration bug that was not identified beforehand
E13,Coding/Development Error,Programming bug that was not identified during development
E14,High Data Traffic on Bus,Real-time processing of high-def cameras can cause latency and bandwidth limitation
E15,Large Distance from Object,Larger distance from object leads to delay in detection and classification
E16,High Vehicle Speed,Higher  vehicle speed gives less time to detect and classify objects hence may lead to inaccurate output
