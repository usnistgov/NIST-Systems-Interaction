behaviorID,Name,Description,Specification
B1,Maintain a lane,Driving along roads predictably and consistently maintaining proper lane position with respect to designated lane markings and speed limits,d_center <= d_max; v_car <= v_max for t(start : end)
B2,Change Lane,"Lane change (right/left) to establish proper lane position in an adjacent lane, which can include merging and passing into oncoming traffic",
B3,Navigating intersection,"Approaching, driving through, or turning at junctions adhering to traffic control devices, as defined in Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).",traffic_signal ; correct lane; VRUs_tracked; yeild on green when turning left; emergency_vehicle != True
B4,"Navigating, entering, exiting unstructured roadways","Approaching, driving through, or turning through roadways that do not have lane markings or clear delineations of traffic directional orientation.",
B5,Navigating pick up and drop off zones and parking situations,"Approaching, driving through, or turning to an area where parking may be restricted or prohibited to improve access for short-term curbside operations (including rideshare, airports, parking lots, parallel parking, school zones, act of stopping, VRUs in and out, and markings)",
B6,Responding to vulnerable road users(VRUs),"Maintaining a safety envelope [4] with respect to VRUs(pedestrians, pedalcyclists)",d_VRU >=  d_safety_env
B7,Responding to other vehicles,"Maintaining a safety envelope with respect to other vehicles where another vehicle may be moving from an adjacent lane into the subject lane, ahead of the subject vehicle, either from the same direction or oncoming (e.g., leading, adjacent, encroaching, oncoming, stopped, cut-ins, cut-outs/reveal, wrong direction).",d_vehicles >=  d_safety_env
B8,Responding to special purpose vehicles,"Where “special purpose vehicles” include emergency vehicles as defined in the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, government-owned vehicles, hearses, safety vehicles, school busses, etc.",
B9,Responding to lane obstructions and obstacles,"Responding to lane obstructions or obstacles can involve partial or complete lane obstructions with static or dynamic objects but is not meant to capture situations where a formal lane change is required to pass, and which is considered a complete lane blockage.",d_safe <= d_max for t = end
B10,Responding to confined road structures,"Driving straight through sections of road with limited or no shoulders, potentially restricted or reduced lanes, overhead constraints, atypical reflections, and rapidly changing environmental conditions (lighting, surface conditions, etc.) from the normal roadway",
B11,Responding to work zones,"Navigating work zones can involve detecting the work zones and temporary signage, and responding appropriately, including with respect to speeds, human traffic controllers, and navigating lane overrides or shifts",
B12,Responding to DDT performance-relevant failure,A failure is any malfunction that prevents the ADS from reliably performing the DDT on a sustained basis,
B13,Responding to relevant traffic control devices,"Per MUTCD (2021), “traffic control devices include all signs, signals, markings, channelizing devices, or other devices that use color, shapes, symbols, words, sounds, and/or tactile information for the primary purpose of communicating a regulatory warning, or guidance message to road users on a street, highway, pedestrian facility, bikeway, pathway or private roadway open to public travel.”",control_devices_detected == control_devices_in_scene
B14,Responding to external communication signals,The vehicle appropriately responds to messages transmitted from an external source through V2X communication. Note: This behavior is not part of AVSC document and has been added for experiment.,Time_to_process <= t
