influenceID,Name,Description
I1,Signal Interference,"Sensors singals can be disrupted by weather, electronic devices or infrastructure"
I2,Hardware Malfunction,Faulty sensors or degraded wiring can cause loss of signal
I3,Software Bugs,Update to vehicle's operating system can cause communication to lag between sensors and central unit
I4,Bug in Serialization,It leads to malformed data being sent causing loss of packets 
I5,Latency in Communication,Signal might be lagging due to multiple factors
I6,Data Bandwidth Limitation,Real-time processing from multiple high-defination cameras can cause latency in transmission
I7,Connectivity Issues/Loss of Signal,Signal might be lost due to external factors
I8,Channel Congestion,It leads limited bandwidth and causes loss of data
I9,Loss of Packets/Data,"Some packets are dropped due to channel congestion, limited bandwidth or high traffic on bus "
I10,High Classification Uncertainity,Uncertainity output by the classifier is high or confidence score is low
I11,Misclassification,Misidentifying cruicial scene elements due to adverse weather conditions leading to incorrect decision making
I12,Incorrect Detection Location,Bounding box around object is not at the accurate location
I13,Delay in Detection,Latency in object detection
I14,Inaccurate/Noisy in Sensor Data,Dirty sensors might cause misinterpretation the environment
I15,Real-Time Processing Delay,Processing sensor data for long may lead to delayed reactions
I16,Incorrect data formatting,It may lead to package verification failure
I17,Package verification failure,"Verification might me fail due to connection issues, development error or even manufactuing defect"
I18,Blocking wanted messages,Messages could be blocked due to bandwidth limitation or high data traffic
I19,Letting Through Unwanted Messages,Can lead to unsafe situations
I20,Encryption Keys Not Changing,Can lead to unsafe situations
I21,Misformat of keys,Encryption keys can be misformatted leading to
I22,Incorrect Decision Making Algorithm,Decision making algorithm can be impacted by external factors leading to unsafe situations
I23,Lack of Fallback Mechanisms,No backup in case of system failure can lead to potential collisions
